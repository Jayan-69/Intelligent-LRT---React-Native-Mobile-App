Here's the route for the LRT system. Starting from Ragama, Pahala Karagahamuna, Kadawatha, Mahara, Kiribathgoda, Tyre Junction, Pattiya Junction, Paliyagoda, Ingurukade Junction, Armour Street Junction, Maradana, Pettah, Slave Island, Gangaramaya, Kollupitiya, Bambalapitiya, Bauddhaloka Mawatha, Thimbirigasyaya, Havelock Town and  Kirulapona. This is the route that i selected for my project. Let me mention the main stops in this route. Ragama, Kadawatha, Kiribathgoda, Paliyagoda, maradana, Pettah, Bambalapitiya and kirulapone. So u can take those main stops while managing express trains. So now what u want to do is make a time table for this route. There needs to be more trains on office time. Specially between 6.00am to 9.00am and 4.00pm to 7.00pm Both slow and express trains. and make 2 intercity trains that start from ragama then stops at pettah and inly kirulapone in the morning office time and evening office time up and down that meand ragama to kirulapone and back kirtlapone to ragama and also mae some trains ragama to pattah pettah to ragama and pettah to kirulapone and kirulapone to pettah as slow trains Actuallu now u know what i want exactly so make a time table for this and make the prices the ticket prices for each slow express and intercity in LKR format. pls be kond enough to add few trains between non office times un and down.
